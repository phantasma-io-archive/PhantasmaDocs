						<h2 class="section-heading">Fees</h2>
						<p>All core chain functionality except smart contract and token deployment charges the user a very low fee of around 0.003–0.005 KCAL, and these values can be adjusted through governance proposals. 50% of every transaction fee is burned, 25% is distributed to block producers and the remaining 25% is distributed to the CROWN reward pool unless the dApp being interacted with requires this portion to be sent to the dApp provider</p>
						<p>Smart contract and token deployment comes at an increased cost, pegged to a fiat value by Phantasma’s native oracles. A developer who wishes to deploy a smart contract for his dApp pays a fee of $10 in its KCAL equivalent. The full amount of KCAL is immediately burned on contract deployment.</p>
						<p>For a project building on top of Phantasma that needs its own token, a fee of $100 in its KCAL equivalent is charged on token creation — also this 100% burned. The same applies to artists and others who wish to deploy their own NFT minting smart contract to be able to mint $ARTISTNAME NFTs instead of the default $GHOST NFTs native to GhostMarket.</p>
						<p>dApp providers may charge additional fees for using their products, such as GhostMarket and uMint's KCAL fees for creating NFTs.</p>
