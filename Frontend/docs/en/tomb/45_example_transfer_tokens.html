<h4>Example: Transfer Tokens</h4> 
<p>
	A contract that takes a payment in tokens from a user.<br/>
	Showcases how to transfer tokens and how to use macro $THIS_ADDRESS to obtain address of the contract.
</p>	

<pre><code>
contract test {
	import Runtime;
	import Token;

	public paySomething(from:address, quantity:number)
	{
		Runtime.expect(Runtime.isWitness(from), "witness failed");

		local price: number := 10;
		price *= quantity;

		local thisAddr:address := $THIS_ADDRESS;
		Token.transfer(from, thisAddr, "SOUL", price);

		// TODO after payment give something to 'from' address
	}
}
</code></pre>
