<h4>Example: Call method</h4> 
<p>
	Showcases how a contract method can call other methods.<br/>
If a method is declared private, it can't be called by anyone except the actual contract that implements it.
</p>	

<pre><code>
contract test {
	private sum(a:number, b:number) {
		return a + b;
	}

	public calculatePrice(x:number): number
	{		
		local price: number := 10;
		price := this.sum(price, x); // here we use 'this' for calling another method

		return price;
	}
}
</code></pre>
