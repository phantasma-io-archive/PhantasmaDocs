<h4>Example: Map</h4> 
<p>The compiler supports generic types, including maps.<br/>
	Maps are one of the few types that don't have to initialized in the constructor.<br/></p>
<pre><code>
	contract test {
		global my_state: storage_map<address, number>;
	
		constructor(owner:address)
		{
			my_state.set(owner, 42);
		}
	
		public getState(target:address):number
		{
			return my_state.get(target);
		}
	}
</code></pre>
