<h4>Example: Counter per Address</h4> 
<p>Another contract that implements a counter, this time unique per user address.<br/>
	Showcases how to validate that a transaction was done by user possessing private keys to 'from' address</p>

<pre><code>
contract test {
	import Runtime;
	import Map;

	global counters: storage_map<address, number>;

	public increment(from:address)
	{
		Runtime.expect(Runtime.isWitness(from), "witness failed");
		local temp: number;
		temp := counters.get(from);
		temp += 1;
		counters.set(from, temp);
	}
}
</code></pre>
