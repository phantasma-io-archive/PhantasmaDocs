<h4>Custom events 2</h4> 
<p>
	A more complex version of the previous example, showcasing custom description scripts.
</p>	

<pre><code>
description payment_event {

	code(from:address, amount:number): string {
		local result:string := "";
		result += from;
		result += " paid ";
		result += amount;
		return result;
	}
}

contract test {
	event MyPayment:number = payment_event; // here we use a short-form declaration

	// everything else would be same as previous example
}
</code></pre>
