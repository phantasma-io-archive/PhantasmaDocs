<h4>Scripts</h4> 
<p>
	A script is something that can be used either for a transaction or for an API invokeScript call.<br/>
This example showcases a simple script with one argument, that calls a contract.<br/>
Note that for scripts with arguments, for them to run properly you will have to push them into the stack before.
</p>	

<pre><code>
script startup {

	import Call;

	code(target:address) {
		local temp:number := 50000;
		Call.contract("Stake", "Unstake", target, temp);
	}
}
</code></pre>
