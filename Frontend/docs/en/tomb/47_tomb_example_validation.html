<h4>Validation</h4> 
<p>
	Runtime.Expect offers a clean way to validate conditions.<br/>
The developer of a smart contract must be very careful to ensure that no exploits are possible due to missing validations.<br/>
</p>	

<pre><code>
contract test {
	import Runtime;

	public doSomething(from:address)  {
		Runtime.expect(from.isUser(), "expected user address"); // makes sure the address is of 'user' type
		Runtime.expect(Runtime.isWitness(from), "invalid witness"); // makes sure the transaction was signed by 'from' address
		Runtime.expect(Runtime.gasTarget() == $THIS_ADDRESS, "invalid donation"); // makes sure the transaction fees are donated to this contract

		// actually do something after passing all validation
	}
}
</code></pre>
