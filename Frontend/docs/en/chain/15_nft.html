<h2 class="section-heading">NFTs</h2>
<p>Phantasma native support for tokens also include proper builtin support for non-fungible tokens (aka NFTs), which can be minted on demand, with a single transaction currently being able to mint up to 100 NFTs, at a almost free cost.</p>

<h4 id="nft-standard">Standard</h4>

<p>NFTs in Phantasma support the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>TokenID - A unique 256-bit number used to identify a NFT instance.</li>
<li>SeriesID - A number that specifies which series a NFT instance belongs to.</li>
<li>MintID - A sequential number that indicates the order in which this instance was minted in it's series.</li>
<li>ROM - Each NFT instance contains it's own ROM area, where read-only data can reside. This data is saved during mint, and can never be modified. The hash of this data is used to generate an unique ID for the NFT, meaning that each NFT instance must have unique ROM data. The ROM can be used to store what makes each instance unique, for example in a game that uses NFTs for characters, the ROM data could contain the character name and stats.</li>
<li>RAM - The counterpart to the ROM, the RAM is the data in a NFT that can change over a NFT lifetime. </li>
</ul>
<p>Both ROM and ROM of a NFT just represent a variable size byte array, it's up for the dapps developers to chose the data structure of this blob. The <a href="#vm-tomb">TOMB compiler</a> abstracts both ROM and RAM into developer friendly custom structs, that make easy to read and write those fields.</p>
<p>A developer wishing can easily query a <a href="#spook">Phantasma node</a> to obtain information about a specific NFT instance, using the available endpoint <a href="#api-GetNFT">GetNFT</a>.</p>


<h4 id="nft-infusion">Infusion</h4>
<p>Phantasma based NFTs can be infused with other Phantasma NFTs.<br>Infusion in this sense means that a NFT will contain other NFTs inside it. The NFTs that are inside can be obtained only by burning the parent NFT.
<br>There is no limit, so infusion can be stacked, with multiple NFTs being infused inside other infused NFTs, recursively.
<br>The <a href="#chain-staking">CROWN</a> NFT is an example of NFTs using infusion.</p>

<p>For deeper diving, the code implementation of the tokens is available at <a href="https://github.com/phantasma-io/PhantasmaChain/blob/master/Phantasma.Blockchain/Tokens/TokenUtils.cs">Github</a>.</p>
